## Software: MORIS (Multi-Physics Optimization Research and Innov)

MORIS is a shape/topology optimization tool for multiphysics problems. Its primary applications
include various structural and fluid interaction problems. It consists of five module primarily which
includes HMR, XTK, GEN, FEM and OPT. HMR generates background mesh for the problem, XTK decomposes and
triangulates the mesh at the interface of multi-phase problems, GEN is a geometry engine, FEM is a finite
element module and OPT is an optimization module. Currently, optimization is based on level-set field
formulation with extendded finite element formulation. MORIS also offers various workflows depending on the 
type of problem. Various examples have been demonstrated for each workflow. Some of the workflows include 
HMR-XTK-FEM workflow, STK-FEM workflow, STK-XTK workflow. Each workflow is suited for different types of problems.
